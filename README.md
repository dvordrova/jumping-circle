## Bouncing circle
Circle is bouncing on rubber rope

### Inspired by specification like
Simple Python 2D application with physic of colliding. Bouncing solid figure "circle"
on "rubber rope with fixed ends" which is contained from few segments. 
The most persistent can do more complex example in 3D - jumping ball on trampoline.
Usage of PyOpenGL will be more preferable.
